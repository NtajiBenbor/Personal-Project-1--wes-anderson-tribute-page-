            <h3>The French Dispatch</h3>
            <p>Faced with the impending dissolution of The French Dispatch, a factual weekly report on various subjects, old-school editor-in-chief Arthur Howitzer Jr. assembles the crème de la crème of the magazine's loyal expatriate journalists for one final issue. And against the backdrop of picturesque Ennui-sur-Blasé, Paris, France, three feature articles unfold. The vignettes pivot around tormented genius artists, statuesque prison officers, flamboyant critics, moody idealists, conflicted ace reporters, legendary chefs and, of course, the police.</p>
