          <h2>BIO</h2>
          <p>
            Wesley Wales Anderson is an American filmmaker. His films are known
            for their eccentricity, unique visual and narrative styles, and
            frequent use of ensemble casts. They often contain themes of grief,
            loss of innocence, and dysfunctional families. Anderson is cited by
            some critics as a modern-day example of an auteur.
